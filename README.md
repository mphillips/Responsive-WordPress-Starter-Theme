##About

This is responsive WordPress starter theme for developers. The goal is a theme that’s stripped down just enough to be useful, but not so much that you have to start from scratch. Includes default styles for common WordPress elements (entries, comments, galleries, etc.).

Built on top of the [Responsive](http://responsivebp.com) framework by James South.

Based on WordPress’ [Twenty Twelve Theme](http://wordpress.org/themes/twentytwelve).
